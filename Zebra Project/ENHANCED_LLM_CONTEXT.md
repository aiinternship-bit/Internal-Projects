AI RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

Based on your requirements for healthcare wristband printing, I recommend
the ZD220 desktop printer. Here's a comprehensive analysis:

PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: ZD220

The ZD220 is specifically designed for healthcare environments with several
features that make it ideal for wristband printing:

WRISTBAND SUPPORT:
The printer explicitly supports wristband media types, as listed in its
media specifications. The media width range of 1.00 to 4.4 inches
accommodates standard healthcare wristband sizes.

HEALTHCARE-SPECIFIC FEATURES:
1. Reliability: Built with dual-wall frame construction for durability in
   busy healthcare settings where consistent operation is critical

2. Easy Operation: Features a single LED status indicator and one-button
   feed/pause control, making it simple for medical staff to operate
   without extensive training

3. Print Speed: At 4 inches per second with 203 DPI resolution, it
   provides fast patient identification band printing without sacrificing
   barcode readability

4. Connectivity: USB connectivity enables easy integration with hospital
   information systems and EMR software

5. Compact Design: Desktop form factor (8.6" L x 6.9" W x 5.9" H for
   direct thermal) fits on nursing station counters without taking up
   valuable space

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR YOUR USE CASE:
- Media Types: Explicitly supports wristbands along with labels, tags,
  and receipts
- Media Width: 1.00-4.4 inches (accommodates adult and pediatric bands)
- Maximum Label Length: 39 inches (suitable for long-form wristbands)
- Print Method: Available in both thermal transfer and direct thermal
  (direct thermal recommended for short-term wristband applications)

OPERATIONAL BENEFITS:
- Energy Star qualified to reduce operational costs
- OpenACCESS clamshell design for quick media changes during busy shifts
- 2-year warranty with available Zebra OneCare support for priority
  service in critical healthcare environments

This printer balances the reliability requirements of healthcare with the
specific capabilities needed for wristband printing, making it an excellent
choice for patient identification applications.

## Cost Implications

### Token Usage
- **Before:** ~1,200 tokens/query (800 input + 400 output)
- **After:** ~3,500 tokens/query (2,500 input + 1,000 output)

### Cost
- **Before:** ~$0.01 per query
- **After:** ~$0.025 per query

**Worth it?** Absolutely - responses are 3-5x more detailed and useful.

## Testing

Try these queries to see the difference:

```bash
# Complex query
python src/printer_rag.py "I need a printer for a manufacturing floor that can handle high volumes, needs to be rugged, and must support Ethernet connectivity"

# Specific technical query
python src/printer_rag.py "What printer supports 2D barcodes like QR codes and has the fastest print speed?"

# Use case query
python src/printer_rag.py "Which printer is best for printing shipping labels in a warehouse?"
```

## Technical Details

### Context Structure

```python
# For each printer (top 3)
context = {
    "basic_info": {
        "model": "ZD220",
        "category": "desktop",
        "relevance_score": 0.875,
        "source_file": "zd220-spec-sheet.pdf"
    },
    "metadata": {
        "resolution_dpi": 203,
        "print_speed_ips": 4.0,
        "max_media_width": 4.4,
        "energy_star": True,
        "connectivity": ["USB"]
    },
    "matching_sections": [
        {
            "type": "overview",
            "match_score": 0.92,
            "content": "[FULL TEXT]"
        },
        {
            "type": "specifications",
            "match_score": 0.85,
            "content": "[FULL TEXT]"
        },
        # ... all matching chunks
    ]
}
```

### Prompt Engineering

The enhanced prompt:
1. Establishes Claude as an expert
2. Clearly separates user query from context
3. Provides numbered, specific instructions
4. Emphasizes thoroughness and evidence
5. Requests organized, structured responses
6. Encourages comparison and trade-off analysis

## Configuration

No configuration changes needed! The enhancement is automatic when LLM mode is enabled.

To disable and use basic mode:
```bash
python src/printer_rag.py "query" --no-llm
```

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:

1. **Adaptive context**: Vary detail level based on query complexity
2. **Caching**: Cache common queries to reduce costs
3. **Multi-turn**: Support follow-up questions with conversation history
4. **Custom prompts**: Allow users to customize the system prompt
5. **Confidence scoring**: Have Claude rate its confidence in recommendations

## Summary

The enhanced LLM integration now provides:
- ✅ **Complete context** - No information truncation
- ✅ **All matching sections** - 4-6 chunks per printer vs 2
- ✅ **Full metadata** - All specs and capabilities
- ✅ **Better prompts** - More specific instructions
- ✅ **Longer responses** - 4,000 tokens vs 1,500
- ✅ **Higher quality** - Evidence-based, detailed recommendations

**Result:** Professional-grade printer recommendations that reference specific features and provide comprehensive analysis.
