Instead of conserving budget, customers are left with greater expense and hassle.\nZebra does it differently. The ZD220 desktop printer gives you reliable operation and basic features at an affordable price—both at\nthe point of purchase and across the entire lifecycle. Engineered with Zebra quality, it boasts a dual-wall construction for added\ndurability. And, it is ENERGY STAR™ qualified to reduce your operational expenses. Built to last for years, the ZD220 provides an\noutstanding return on your investment.\nBasic Features for Simple Operation\nThis 4-inch printer produces labels quickly, at 4 in. per second,\nto keep your workflows moving.
